## Our Story

#### We met in the summer of 2011 through our local swing dancing scene. We struck up a friendship in spite of the odd-looking vibram five-finger shoes Scott was wearing. After bonding over fall TV programs, wine tasting excursions with friends, and kareoke parties, we departed for Christmas break still friends. Fast forward to New Year's Eve, when, after a night of singing and enjoying the apple pie moonshine Scott had brought up from North Carolina, the clock struck midnight. It was then that we decided to begin the new year as a couple. 

#### Since that night, we have been inseparable (aside from Karen moving to NC for grad school).
